Learnt about how to import data to PowerBI from different sources which include
Excel, Ms Access, data from Web and also, data from Excel Pivot table model.
While accessing data from Ms Access, I encountered an error whereby the data seeems 
incompatible with the PowerBI.  I was able to resolve the issue by installing 
AccessDatabase Engine X-64 redistributed. The PowerBI on my machine is a 64-bit application
while the Office 365 is a 32-bit which was what led to the incompatibility.

There is also difference between "Get Data" and "Import" Data. Knowing when to 
use each one of them will help when using PowerBI.

Import data is useful when bringing in Power models from excel, while Get data 
is more useful when bringing direct data as it is in excel.

When sharing the PowerBI you create with other people, you have to send them the
source data from excel to them as well, because without the data source, the user
will be limited in what they can do with the PowerBI desktop file.

Data Transformation
In this aspect, I learnt how to rename fields, populate first rows as headers
in a table, how to add or remove columns from tables, how to add values to a table.
Also, using power query to do some of this transformation is part of what was
discussed in the training video. 

Enhancing Data Model
Under this topic, I learnt how to merge two tables together when they have a 
common column. I can merge as a new query in Power Query window or merge into the 
existing query. When performing the merging, I can choose the "Join Types" that
is suitable for what I want to do.
